        <h1>My Web Design Journey</h1>

        <p>I hope to learn alot in this class. I took coding once in high school but to be honest I dont remeber much about it. I am fascinated by tech and I love computers so im sure this class will be just for me.<em> I would really like to make a webpage showing off all of my socials and showing of my favorite games I like to play</em> I always knew since I was a child that i loved to surf the internt. I stumble upon projects that indie developers will come up with and I love to see what people can do and I aspire to be like them one day. It blows my mind that people my age can do this like a pro and can make money off of it. </p>
